		# Except on turn 1, or if the trade ship is on the "not worth it" space:

		# Each player gains up to N hay token per person (who is not in Vinland
		# or hunting walrus) per soil fertility level.  On a warm year, N=4, a
		# temperate year, N=3, and a cold year, N=2.  Move each player's soil
		# fertility counter down (less fertile) by E * T /3 (rounding up), where
		# E is the soil erosion rate, and T is the number of hay tokens actually

		# * sequence point (can trade)

		# Players go around in a circle, starting from the dealer, to cut down a

		# passes; once a player has passed, they may not later decide to cut
		# down a tree.  Each player may cut up to one tree (or deconstruct up to
		# one of their boats) per person token, gaining a timber token and, if
		# cutting a tree, moving the tree counter down one.
