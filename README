A card game invented by Dave Turner, inspired by the chapter 
in Jared Diamond's _Collapse_ where the Vikings go to Greenland and
then they all die. 

I'm currently working on modeling the game, and then I'll get to 
defining some player strategies and running them through to see if 
any of them actually work, or if the game rules need to be modified. 

VERY in-progress.
