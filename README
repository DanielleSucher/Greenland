A card game invented by Dave Turner, inspired by the chapter in Jared 
Diamond's _Collapse_ where the Vikings go to Greenland and then they all die. 

Greenland is currently playable in the terminal - just navigate to the directory 
where you saved it and type in "ruby greenland-play.rb" and have fun!

To run simulations with pre-set strategies, edit greenland-sim.rb to reflect the 
specs of the test you need to run (details needed indicated in the comments) and 
have at. (Though at the moment, the only strategy defined so far is the 
human-playable default strategy, StdInput.)

Next steps:

1. Define a few other strategy subclasses.

2. Run simulations with those strategies to test gameplay and see if any of them 
actually work, or if the game rules need to be modified.
