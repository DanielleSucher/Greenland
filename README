A card game invented by Dave Turner, inspired by the chapter in Jared 
Diamond's _Collapse_ where the Vikings go to Greenland and then they all die. 

Greenland is currently playable in the terminal - just navigate to the directory 
where you saved it and type in "ruby greenland-play.rb" and have fun!

My next steps:

1. Define a Strategy class and set the inputs to come from Strategy 
instead of from @stdin.gets.

2. Define a strategy that takes input from @stdin.gets, and set greenland-play 
to that one, so it works basically the same way it does now.

3. Define a few other basic strategies.

4. Run simulations with those strategies to test gameplay and see if any of them 
actually work, or if the game rules need to be modified.
